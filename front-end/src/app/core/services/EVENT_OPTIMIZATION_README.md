# Event Service Optimization - Local Filtering

## Overview
The EventService has been optimized to implement client-side filtering, which reduces API calls and improves performance when applying filters to events.

## Key Changes

### 1. Event Caching
- Events are fetched from the API once and cached in memory
- Subsequent filter operations work on the cached data
- Cache can be manually refreshed when needed

### 2. Local Filtering
- All filter operations (search, venue, date range) are performed locally
- No API calls are made when filters change
- Instant filtering response for better user experience

### 3. New Methods Added

#### `refreshEvents(): Observable<Event[]>`
- Forces a fresh API call to reload events
- Updates the cache with latest data
- Use when you need to sync with server data

#### `getCachedEvents(): Observable<Event[]>`
- Returns an observable of cached events
- Useful for components that need real-time updates
- Automatically emits when cache is updated

#### `applyFilters(events: Event[], filters?: EventFilters): Event[]`
- Private method that handles all filtering logic
- Reusable for both mock and API data
- Supports all filter types: search, venue, date range

### 4. Improved Methods

#### `getEvents(filters?: EventFilters): Observable<Event[]>`
- **Before**: Always made API calls with filters
- **After**: Uses cached data for filtering when available
- First call loads and caches data, subsequent calls filter locally

#### `getEventById(id: string): Observable<Event | undefined>`
- **Before**: Always made API call
- **After**: Checks cache first, falls back to API if needed

#### `getCategories()` and `getVenues()`
- **Before**: Made API calls to get all events then extract unique values
- **After**: Use cached events when available, reducing API calls

## Performance Benefits

1. **Reduced API Calls**: After initial load, filtering doesn't require server requests
2. **Faster Response**: Local filtering is instant vs. network latency
3. **Better UX**: No loading states when applying filters
4. **Bandwidth Savings**: Less data transfer after initial load
5. **Server Load**: Reduced server requests for filtering operations

## Usage Example

```typescript
// Component example
export class EventListComponent implements OnInit {

  ngOnInit() {
    // Initial load - fetches from API and caches
    this.events$ = this.eventService.getEvents();

    // Filter changes - uses cached data (no API calls)
    this.filterForm.valueChanges.pipe(
      debounceTime(300),
      distinctUntilChanged()
    ).subscribe(filters => {
      // This uses cached data - instant response!
      this.events$ = this.eventService.getEvents(filters);
    });
  }

  refreshData() {
    // Force refresh from API when needed
    this.eventService.refreshEvents().subscribe();
  }
}
```

## When to Use

### Use Local Filtering When:
- Users frequently change filters
- Dataset is relatively small (< 10,000 events)
- Real-time filtering experience is important
- Network bandwidth is limited

### Consider Server-Side Filtering When:
- Very large datasets (> 10,000 events)
- Complex filtering logic on server
- Data changes frequently
- Memory constraints on client

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Components
1. No breaking changes to public API
2. Existing `getEvents(filters)` calls work the same
3. Add `refreshEvents()` calls where manual refresh is needed

### For New Components
1. Use the provided `EventListComponent` as reference
2. Implement debounced filter changes for better UX
3. Add refresh functionality for data synchronization

## Future Enhancements

1. **Cache Expiration**: Add automatic cache refresh after time period
2. **Offline Support**: Store cache in localStorage for offline access
3. **Pagination**: Implement virtual scrolling for large datasets
4. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live event updates
